  A long, long time ago (not in a galaxy far away....that would be <a href="https://starwars.com">Star Wars</a>, webpages were single documents.  Now we have web sites.  Pages like <a href="https://www.google.com">Google Search Engine</a>
  are really single pages only because they dynamically create pages.  Today, we will go to <a href="https://classroom.google.com">Google Classroom</a> and look at how links have evolved over time.
